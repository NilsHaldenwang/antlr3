status:
  - at the start, i ported everything from notes/python/initial-version
    to ruby
  - after discovering a significantly updated version of the python
    runtime packaged with ANTLR 3.1.3, i spent several days examining
    diffs, making updates to the API, and adding the new features
    provided in the newer version
  - i then spent a few days porting MOST of the python unit tests in
    notes/python/current-suit/unittest to ruby Test::Unit unit
    tests, all of which are found in test/test-*.rb
  - I added the rake task test:all to run the tests
  - I've been piping the test results to log/test-results.log
  - I've fixed most of the errors that have come up during tests,
    but right now I still need to keep clearing the tests until
    it's all clean

to do still:
  - finish correcting test errors until clean
  - examine the API and see if there's a more sensible way to organize it (refactor)
  - update tests accordingly and clear them out
  - write the ruby StringTemplate groups so antlr will make proper output
    - may require study of ANTLR extending
  - add documentation
