  - i have finished the full initial port from the runtime library
    i have stored in /usr/lib/python2.5
  - i found out that the more recent runtime library at
    ~/lib/packages/antlr-3.1.3/runtime/Python has a lot more
    stuff and has some major changes
  - I started re-tailoring the library to reflect the changes
    made in the more recent version
  - i've updated/checked:
    - constants.py
    - exceptions.py
  - i've started
    - recognizers.py
  * i stopped at the __init__ in BaseRecognizer, where it starts
    checking runtime version

to do still:
  - finish updating to the current runtime
  - write the generator templates
  - model unit tests after the current runtime unit tests
  - try it out

some other issues I'm aware of:
  - i've messed up the whole LA/LT/LB thing, calling it
    'look_ahead' when they often mean different things --
    ya gotta go back and check out how it was done
