== refactoring

- all streams should have #consume return the stepped-over symbol
- if so, all match methods can be refactored to take out superfluous "current_symbol" assignments
- template code can be reduced a decent bet by joining everything that's like
    label = @input.look
    match_method
  to
    label = match_method
