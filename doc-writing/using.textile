h1. Getting Started With ANTLR3 For Ruby

div(step). Step 1: Download / Install

* If you have rubygems:

« cmd
sudo gem install antlr3   # or whatever form of this command appropriate for your system
»

* Otherwise, get a tarball or zip from "rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/antlr3 , unpack, and ensure @lib/antlr3.rb@ can be loaded with <tt>require 'antlr3'</tt>

div(step). Step 2: Write an ANTLR Grammar

* For general information on writing grammars, read up on ANTLR's "official documentation":http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/ANTLR+v3+printable+documentation
* For ruby output, the grammar must declare <<tt>language = Ruby;</tt> in its top-level @options@ block

div(step). Step 3: Run the ANTLR Tool

« cmd
antlr4ruby path/to/your/Grammar.g
»

* the @antlr4ruby@ command is just a simple wrapper around the command <tt>java org.antlr.Tool</tt>. It makes sure the customized ANTLR jar bundled up with this package is in the java class path to get correct output.
* for information on using the ANTLR tool command, refer to the "official documentation":http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/ANTLR+v3+printable+documentation
* assuming ANTLR doesn't have any serious complaints about your grammar, you should now have a number of ruby output files containing your recognition code
